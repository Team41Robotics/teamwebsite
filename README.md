## Setup

First make sure to run `npm install`. This will install all the necessary dependencies.

There are two important scripts you can use during development.

- `npm start` runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.
- `npm run deploy` builds the app and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

## Contributing

My personal suggestion (as [the Peter Linder](https://github.com/peterapps)) is to use the [Atom](https://atom.io/) IDE. If so, install the packages `prettier-atom`, `linter`, `linter-ui-default`, and `linter-eslint`. It'll make your code pretty. I believe [the James Narayanan](https://github.com/JamesNarayanan) is more partial to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which also has a Prettier extension. Make sure to enable "Format on save" so it gets prettified automatically.
